<h2 class="font-bold underline">Bingo business model</h2>
<br>
<p>The business model for bingo will consist of two parts. This gives us an opportunity to target a larger market. The model assumes the use of economy class petrol vehicles. Most delivery services work on a weight related model, to price their service, we’ll focus on that and a distance related model.
The model also assumes that the choice of sharing delivery costs with the customer or not, is solely up to the seller. That is to say, a seller can opt to share delivery costs with their customers, or not. This decision should be made public to the customer, so as to clear bingo of any blame whatsoever.
The table below shows the cost (as risk) associated with carrying a particular range of product value.</p>

The single destination model
This refers to a delivery (one or more items) that is headed for a single address. Typical examples include groceries for an individual or a smartphone for another individual.
The average economy class vehicle uses a litre of petrol for 14-15 km in the highway, this figure falls into 10-12 km range in a local road setting. To allow for errors, this model will assume that the bingo delivery vehicle covers 10 km in any setting. The cost of a litre of petrol as of 18 Aug. 20 is $93 ZWL. Again to allow for errors, this model assumes a cost of $95 ZWL, which transcends to about $0.95 USD. Therefore a distance of 10 km requires $0.95 USD.
For a clearer picture, we’ll use this example. Simba who lives in area A, orders a $600 USD laptop from shop X (situated in area B) via the bingo platform. The driver who receives the order for completion, say driver H is situated in area C. The distance between A and B is 25.3 km, and the distance between C and B is 10 km.
From the example above, the 10 km distance between the driver and the seller should and will be covered by bingo. The customer and or the seller can only pay for the distance actually travelled by the product.
The basic cost of the delivery is $0.095 x 26 km (we always round up) = $2.47 USD
Now we add our charge per km $0.05 x 26 km = $1.30 USD
Finally we add the cost associated with product based on its price and fragility.
A laptop has a fragility of 2, and the value here is 600, therefore,
Fragility cost = $ 0.10
Risk cost = $ 10.00
The total cost of the delivery is $13.87 USD. And the user is expected to pay $613.87 unless the seller has signed up for shared delivery cost, in which case only $606.94.
The option to not pay for the risk associated with a particular product, is available. In this particular case the cost would fall to $603.77 or $601.89 with shared delivery. However, bingo will not reimburse your package in the case that something happens in transit.
The batch delivery option
Too make things simpler and more affordable for the business and the customer, a batch delivery system exists. Delivery with the batch system is not done as soon as possible, but rather done on a scheduled time-table. If a customer misses the dispatch time, they’ll have to wait until the next dispatch time to have their package en-route. Here the pricing method used is based mainly on the weight and size of the package in question.
Example: A batch delivery under Mobillo (a mobile phone company) is dispatched at 1600 hours. The batch contains 15 mobile devices. 5 of them are valued at $500 each weighing 150g, 3 of them are valued at $230 each weighing 165g and 7 at $700 each weighing 140g. The shortest calculated route that covers all 15 destinations is 67.7 km long.
The basic cost is $0.095 x 68 km = $6.46 USD
Our charge per km $0.05 x 68 km = $3.40 USD
 Value and fragility.
A mobile phone falls under the fragility value of 2, hence the cost in this case is:
($0.10 x 15)/2 = $0.75
The total value of the whole package is $8090.00 therefore the risk assumed is $100.00. This is divided amongst the buyers by using the value of their packages as weights.
The weight of the whole package is 2.225kg which comes to $0.10. This is distributed amongst the buyers.
The total cost of the delivery is $110.71 bringing the total cost to $8200.71. In this case it can be anything between $8200.71 and $8090.71, because some customers may go for the insurance and others may not.
